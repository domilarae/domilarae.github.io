Hi, I'm Dominique! I have a healthcare background and currently, I am in graduate school for a MS in Data Science. I have developed a strong foundation in the life sciences and a passion for analyzing data to create meaningful insights. I am excited to bring my skills to the field of data science. 
In my free time, I enjoy exploring data analysis tools and techniques with healthcare data sets. I hope to use this website to display my findings as a way to aid my journey. 

This is a website to showcase skills, projects and track my progression in data sicence related topics. 

### My story

I am a medical laboratory scientist with an interest in microbiology & infectious disease. I started my journey in data science by learning computation with Python in 2022. Since then, I have picked up an interest in data analysis with R and SQL, as well as a curiosity for data ethics. Feel free to join me on my journey!
